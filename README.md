![Game preview](images/mockup.jpg?raw=true)

## What is it
Memory is a Dragon Ball-based memory game. 

## How it works
The game is composed of 8 pair of cards that sum up to a total of 16. 
At the beginning of the game all the cards are covered.
The player can unconver up to 2 cards for each turn:
    * if they are equal there is a match
    * otherwise they must be covered again
The player must find the 8 pairs: this forces him/her to remember where the cards are placed.
